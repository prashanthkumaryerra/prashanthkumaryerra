# 👋 Hey there, I'm Prashanth Kumar!

🚀 **DevOps Engineer** | AWS | Terraform | Jenkins | Docker | Kubernetes | CI/CD | Linux

🌱 I'm currently sharpening my skills by building hands-on DevOps labs and real-world infrastructure automation projects on AWS.

### 🧠 What I’m focusing on:
- 🔧 Infrastructure as Code using **Terraform**
- 🌀 CI/CD pipelines with **Jenkins & GitHub Actions**
- ☁️ Cloud provisioning on **AWS** – EC2, VPC, S3, IAM
- 🐳 Containerization using **Docker**
- ☸️ Orchestration with **Kubernetes (EKS)**
- 📦 Automating deployments using **Ansible & Bash scripting**
